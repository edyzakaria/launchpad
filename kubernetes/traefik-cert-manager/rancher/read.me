This values.yaml is overiding the use of self signed rancher issuer.
The requirement is we need to ensure cert-manager already deployed with minimum 1 clusterIssuer.
Currently i use staging, but later when playing time is done i will change the values.yaml to use production.
The syntax to upgrase is using helm since i deploy rancher using helm.

helm upgrade rancher rancher-latest/rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  -f values.yaml
